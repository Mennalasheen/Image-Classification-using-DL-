	Project objective: training multiple (at least two) different CNN models on an image classification task.
	Preprocessing: data augmentation
	CNN Models Used: Alex net, VGG-16

	Vision Transformer is used to enhance image classification performance in conjunction with traditional Convolutional Neural Network models like Alex-Net and VGG-16.
